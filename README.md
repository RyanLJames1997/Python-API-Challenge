# Python-API-Challenge
Module 6 
Ryan James

Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?

Furthermore, this challenge accentuate's my Python coding with the implementation of using specific API's.

The API's used are:
- WeatherPy (used to analyse temperatures across cities globally)
- VacationPy (used to identify hotels in cities globally when given specific parameters)

In this Challenge, the following relationships are observed in WeatherPy:
- Latitude vs. Temperature
- Latitude vs. Humidity
- Latitude vs. Cloudiness
- Latitude vs. Wind Speed

In this Challenge, the following relationships are observed in VacationPy:
- Northern Hemisphere: Temperature (C) vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Temperature (C) vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere: Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude

Furthermore, the r-score is calculated for each relationship to display how strong or weak the correlation is between these variables are.
